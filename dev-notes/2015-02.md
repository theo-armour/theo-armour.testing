2015-03-04 ~ Tuesday

* SRTM: tried to 'crop' binary files - without success

* AlgeSurf: built cute little Lorenz Attractor demo


2015-03-02 ~ Monday

* SRTM: came to the conclusion that the current save to PNG saves with too many errors. Big ;-(

* Completed R3 of vA3C OSM data Viewer

* long phone call with Greg on Abantech future

* Mucked around with merging and shapes


2015-03-02 ~ Sunday

* Fixed Almost all SRTM issues 
	* only near zero errant points issues remain

* Participated in Abantech scrum - was OK

* Completed R2 of vA3C OSM data Viewer
	* Sent link to Dan Macumber
	* Quite happy with the result. Hope Dan is too.


2015-02-28 ~ Saturday

* SRTM 16K new files created. takes about 5 minutes
	* GDAL has just had sand kicked in its face
	* Oops there is an issue with entire Southern Hemisphere but that should not take too long to find
	* The main thing is that a derp such as myself working on a laptop is able to process/mash-up 1.8GB of data and write to 16K files in a few minutes
	* Much of this is due to the V8 JavaScript compiler ( and its competition the other compilers ) and its ability to process web data quickly
		* When you bring this ability to the client-side desktop, it screams
* SRTM: have a simple 3D hello world working - with issues

* Game for Leo R2

* OSM Data Viewer R2
	* Mostly works on my Nvidia tablet

I felt I might get both SRTM and OSM done by today.
Well both are at 95%. Nonetheless it amazes me at how much may be accomplished in a single day.


2015-02-27 ~ Friday

* SRTM going well. see dev notes
* OSM Viewer showing all surfaces with heads-up display
	* The building is the database
	* Anything in the OSM file can be attached to elements in the model
	* No intermediate format is used. The script reads the OSM file and builds the model directly
