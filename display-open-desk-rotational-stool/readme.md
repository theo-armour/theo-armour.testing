### Rotational Stools

_As of this writing, only one stool has been modelled._

The Rotational Stools are a complementary pair that share common proportions (15” tall x 9.5” square) and variations on a rotational structure. They function equally well as low stools or as side tables - individually, in pairs, or in aggregate.

A pair of Rotational Stools requires one fourth of a 4’x8’ sheet of plywood. You can make 8 stools from a single sheet of plywood, or nest parts into unused areas of plywood, as you’re cutting other projects.
