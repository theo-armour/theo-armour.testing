[WikiHouse]( http://www.wikihouse.cc/ )  
WikiHouse is an open source building system. Many designers, collaborating to make it simple for everyone to design, print and assemble beautiful, low-energy homes, customised to their needs.

This script is a first pass at enabling the WikiHouse designs to be viewable using free, open source software while online and hosted an a free platform.
 
You should be able to rotate, zoom and and pan the structure using your pointing device or one, two and three fingers.

The structure is set up in the air so that you may inspect the underside of the structure.

There are a number of issues to be resolved - particularly the long load times. 

Latest release: [Display WikiHouse Studio2]( http://theo-armour.github.io/theo-armour.testing/display-wikihouse-studio2/latest/index.html )

### Road Map

* Obtain access to data for individual components
	* rebuild as JSN/STL files


### System Requirements

In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The apps here are currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 

Script is not running under Internet Explorer. May be running under FireFox. Safari: unlikely.

Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
